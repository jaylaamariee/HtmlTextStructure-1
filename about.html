   <p> Hello! My name is Jayla. I am 15 years old and was born on June 17th 2003.
     I am currently a sophmore at Licking Heights Highschool. I am the oldest of 14 combined siblings.
     Full, step, and half. My audience is more towards females that want to learn ho to do hair.
     It could help anybody to be honest. Males, females, children, adults, etc. I wanted to do this
     because some people at school wanted me to show them how I do certain things. My sisters also ask
     me to teach them. So this is useful for everbody. </p>
